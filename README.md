# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Louise is working on a play "Fever" and wants to see the relationship of previous project outcomes in relation to their launch date and funding goal. The project uses data from past crowdfunding projects. 

### Purpose
The purpose of the learn and use powerful features in excel such as:
- Pivot tables
- Pivot charts 
- Linux timestamp conversion 
- Line charts

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
After performing analysis based on launch date of past **theater** projects it seems to be that most successful project launch in May. The success rate starts to decrease over the summer months with the least number of successful plays taking place in December. Failed and canceled theatre projects seem to be indepdent of the month of the year they are launched in.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
An analysis was performed on outcomes of **plays** based on funding goal it seems that many plays successeeded with a lower funding goal, with the exception of a handful that succeeded with higher funding goals. There were no canceled plays.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The main challenge I found with the assignment is mostly the use of Github and creating the readme files and understanding the syntax to do so. I find excel is simple enough as I use it on a daily basis on my Windows; however, doing the same with a MacOS would surely be more difficult as I have tried to use it before and bumped into many issues. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
My first conclusion would be that launching a project in May has the highest chance of success, and launching a project in December has the lowest chance of success. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The lower the funding goal is of plays the higher change of success. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Some limitations would be undderstanding the reason behind the failed projects, also the platforms that were used to market for the projects should be indicated to give an idea of what the most successful for each project. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Additional tables/graphs that we could created could compare outcomes of different categories in relation to the launch country.
